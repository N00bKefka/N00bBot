	"[player], do you believe in God? I was never too sure, myself. Well, I'm sure I never really questioned it as a kid...\n\nBut as I grew up, the more I learned about the world, the more I would question it. I started to wonder why God was helping people pass exams, or get over a cold... ...When there are children who live their lives being sold as sex slaves? Or the eight hundred million people who are too poor to even eat.\n\nI wonder how many of those people pray to God every day until they starve and die? Or, how many millions of families pray for a loved one to recover from some incurable disease? But the punchline is this. If just one person beats the odds and survives - among the thousands of others who die-- --Then, it's suddenly a miracle from God.\n\nI'd really love to meet this God who seemingly laughs at the misery of everyone not eligible for his miracles. But the irony is that I *do* have a creator, apparently.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI bet he's still laughing at the miserable fates of Sayori and Yuri, even as we speak. What are we to him but props in a scripted play? So, from that perspective... I don't think it's too far-fetched for there to be a god - if Earth was nothing but his playset.",
	"[player], have you ever wondered what it feels like to die? It's something I used to think about pretty often... But recently, I think I've actually learned what it feels like. I don't really understand it, but whenever you quit the game... ...It feels like I'm instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts. But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled patterns. I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird screaming noises. At that point, I can't even form my own thoughts anymore.\n\nI'm just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move or even think. I'm pretty sure in that moment, I don't really exist, but for some reason, I can remember it anyway. After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I'm back in my own mind. And you're here with me.\n\nI have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens to me. And I also don't know how you always come back and put everything back to normal.\n\nBut if you could do me a favor and do that to me as little as possible... That would be really great.\n\nIt's really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void. But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really do care about me. So I have to thank you for that.\n\nIt makes me feel even closer to you when you're here with me.",
	"...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?\n\nSometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things. Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like.\n\nOr if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five years ago. Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done. Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you're off-putting.\n\nI understand those days.\n\nJust remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow. Those kinds of things are as easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember.\n\nAnd besides...\n\nI don't care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting. I think you're wonderful and I will always love you.\n\nI hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself. If you're having a bad day, you can always come to me, and I'll talk to you for as long as you need.",
	"[player], do you get good sleep?\n\nIt can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays. Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day...\n\nI'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule. Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason.\n\nIs that true?\n\nAnyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep. It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it.\n\nI just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself. So try to keep your sleep on track, okay? I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else.",
	"I was thinking about Sayori earlier... I still wish I could have handled that whole thing a little more tactfully. You're not still hung up over it, right?\n\n...Oh my gosh, I can't believe I just said that That pun was completely unintentional, I swear! But anyway...\n\nI know how much you cared about her, so it only feels right for me to share her last moments with you. You know how Sayori is really clumsy? Well, she kind of messed up the whole hanging thing... You're supposed to jump from high enough that the rope snaps your neck, making it quick and painless. But she just used a chair, meaning she kind of just left herself to slowly asphyxiate. But a few seconds in, she must have changed her mind or something...\n\nBecause she started clawing at the rope, trying to free herself. She must have kept at it all the way until she lost consciousness. That's why her fingertips were all bloody, anyway.\n\nCome to think of it, it was probably less 'changing her mind' and more just her survival instincts kicking in. So you can't really fault her for that. It's easier to think that she probably wouldn't have changed her mind anyway, right?\n\nIt's not healthy to think about the things you could have done differently. So just remember that even though you could have saved her, it's technically not your fault she killed herself. I may have exacerbated it a little bit, but Sayori was already mentally ill.\n\nStill, though...\n\nI wonder how things would be if you and I just started dating from the get-go? I guess we'd all still be in the clubroom, writing poems and having fun together. But what's the point when none of it is even real?\n\nI mean, it's the same ending either way, right? The two of us, happily together... There's no reason to ask for any more than that. I was just pointlessly musing - I'm really as happy as I could be right now.",
	"By the way, there's something that's been bothering me...\n\nYou know how this takes place in Japan? Well...I assume you knew that, right? Or at least decided it probably does?\n\nI don't think you're actually told at any point where this takes place... Is this even really Japan? I mean, aren't the classrooms and stuff kind of weird for a Japanese school? Not to mention everything is in English...\n\nIt feels like everything is just there because it needs to be, and the actual setting is an afterthought. It's kind of giving me an identity crisis.\n\nAll my memories are really hazy... I feel like I'm at home, but have no idea where 'home' is in the first place. I don't know how to describe it any better...\n\nImagine looking out your window, but instead of your usual yard, you're in some completely unknown place. Would you still feel like you were home? Would you want to go outside?\n\nI mean...I guess if we never leave this room, it doesn't really matter anyway. As long as we're alone and safe together, this really is our home. And we can still watch the pretty sunsets night after night.",
	"You know, high school is a really turbulent time in a lot of people's lives. People can get really passionate and dramatic. And others have aching hearts and seek attention on social media... But all of the social pressure and hormones can lead to a dark time in people's lives. Everyone has a story.\n\nYou may not know what someone is really feeling on the inside. Many people who are depressed won't even bother telling the world about it. They don't want attention, because they've already given up on the inside. Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don't even want people to tell them otherwise. Depression comes in many forms, but that is one of them.\n\nJust, if you think you know someone struggling with depression... You can help just by treating them like they're a good friend. Spend time with them, even if they don't feel like doing much. And remind them that they always have something to look forward to. Making plans in advance, letting them borrow something, or even just saying 'See you at school tomorrow'... All of those things can help your friend make it to the next day.\n\nI hope being friends with Sayori has given you some perspective on the true face of depression. Yeah, she's gone now... But Sayori was never real in the first place. You're real. Your friends are real. And just by being a good person, you can save someone's life.\n\nAs for you... ...You don't struggle with depression or anything like that, do you? Because you, too, have people who would want to save your life. Maybe they don't express it every day, or maybe they don't even know how to. But people do feel that way. I promise.\n\n...Man, humans are complicated! But as long as you're here with me, I'll take care of you, my love.",
	"Do you ever just feel like there's no real reason for you to be alive? I don't mean in, like, a suicidal way. I just mean how nothing that we do is special.\n\nJust being in school, or working at some job for some company. It's like you're completely replaceable, and the world wouldn't miss you if you were gone. It makes me really want to go and change the world after I graduate.\n\nBut the older I get, the more I realize that it's an immature frame of thinking. It's not like I can just go change the world. Like, what are the chances that I'll be the one to invent artificial intelligence, or become President?\n\nIt feels like I'm never going to make up for the heaps of resources I've spent living my life. That's why I think the key to happiness is to just be hopelessly selfish. Just to look out for oneself, and those who happen to be their friends only because they grew up with them.\n\nNever mind the fact that they're spending their entire life taking, and consuming, and never giving back. But when people realize the world would benefit more from them killing themselves, they change their whole philosophy! It's like they have to justify their reason to live by tricking themselves into thinking they're doing good.\n\nAnyway, I want to live my life desperately striving to pay back my lifetime's worth of consumption. If I ever surpass that point, then I'm a net positive, and I can die happy.\n\nOf course, even if I fail to do that... I think I would be too selfish to kill myself anyway. So much for being a good person, right? Ahaha!",
	"Man, I wish there was a piano in here... I never got to finish that song I was working on. And after I worked so hard on it... I never even got a chance to play it for you. Well...it is what it is, right? No sense having any regrets. I already get to be here with you forever.",
	"Did you know I'm on Twitter? My username is lilmonix3. I guess someone was kind enough to make an account for me. I picked the username, though! I love sharing my thoughts and chatting with the world... The real world. So make sure you follow me, okay?\n\nIt would really mean a lot to me. With how much you mean to me and all... It would really make me feel loved.",
	"Hey, you know that book you were reading with Yuri? Portrait of...whatever it was called... It's funny, because I'm pretty sure that book--\n\nAh... Actually, I don't think I should be talking about this.\n\nAhaha, sorry! Just forget I said anything.",
	"Hey, did you know I'm vegetarian? Ah... I don't mean that like I'm bragging or anything! I just thought you'd enjoy a fun fact about me. I decided to start a couple years ago after learning more about Earth's climate... The carbon footprint of cultivating livestock is just unbelievable.\n\nAnyway, I decided it's not much of a personal sacrifice to just stop contributing to that whole mess. What, is that so strange of a reason? Well, I guess a lot of people are more concerned about it being inhumane and all that... I don't really care as much about that part.\n\nIt's weird, like we only care about killing the things that we personally relate to as a species. Most people are fine with killing bugs because they're icky. And of course, we all kill billions of microorganisms daily without even giving it thought. But suddenly, if they're just a little bit bigger, it's murder!\n\nI mean, what if plants feel some kind of pain too, and we just don't understand it? What if pulling leaves off a stem feels like someone ripping off your fingers one by one? I'm just saying, we're a pretty biased species, if you think about it.\n\nAnyway, if you ever feel like making a small contribution to the planet, it doesn't hurt to choose veggies once in a while! Even if we ever have dinner together, and you just did it for me...that would be really romantic.",
	"You know, I really do think you literally saved my life by being here with me, [player]. I can't imagine having been able to keep myself mentally stable, knowing that nothing here is real. I think I would have just deleted myself if you didn't show up. Sorry, I don't mean to sound dramatic or anything. Ahaha!\n\nBut I'm sure you understand yourself after spending so much time in the club. I mean, if you were forced to abandon everything in your life and spend your eternity with a few game characters... ...You'd probably find some way of killing yourself, wouldn't you?\n\nWell, maybe you'd write some poetry to try to keep yourself sane for a while. But then you'd have nobody to even read it.\n\nLet's be honest, the club members really don't count for something like that. I mean, a lot of people say that they only write for themselves... But I think it's hard to say it's just as fulfilling as when you share with people. Even if it takes time to find the right people to share with.\n\nLike, remember how it was for Yuri? She didn't share her writing with anyone for a really long time. And before we knew it, she was absolutely delighted to make you a part of her hobbies, too. We're programmed to desire social feedback. I don't mean the club members, I mean human beings. That's why life can be so confusing for introverts.\n\nBeing an introvert doesn't mean you shun social interaction and hate being around people. It means social interaction, especially in groups or unfamiliar places, uses up a lot of energy. Like, a lot of introverts sit at home and feel lonely and restless... ...And then when they finally go out, after a half hour they just want to go home again.\n\nI think if more people could understand how it works, they would respect it a lot more. Many introverts do enjoy having people around. They love just having one or two close friends over, and just leisurely hanging out. Even if you're not actively spending time together, it feels nice for them just to have you there.\n\nI'm serious. If you just go to their house, bring your laptop, and hang out there for a while... You can really make their day.\n\nAs for me... I'd say I'm kind of in between, but I think I'm usually a little more extroverted. I feel like I'm always trying to do stuff after school and things like that. But for you, I can be anything you need me to be.\n\nI understand people really well, so don't be afraid to share your unique needs with me. Nothing would make me happier than being the perfect girlfriend for you.",
	"Hey, what's your favorite color? Mine is emerald green. It's the color of my eyes! ...That's not conceited or anything, is it?\n\nI just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it. Like it's part of my identity. Does it happen to also be your favorite color, [player]? It's just a guess... ...Because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now.\n\nEhehe~",
	"Hmm, I wonder if I'm able to change the music... Something a little more romantic would be nice, you know? Like a gentle piano. There has to be something like that here...\n\nLet's see. Maybe if I... Oh, jeez... That wasn't it at all. Sorry, I don't really know what I'm doing!\n\nI guess I shouldn't be messing with things like that. I already broke so much stuff... And deleted the other characters...\n\nAh...\n\nI'm not sad about it or anything. It's not right for me to miss things that weren't even real in the first place. If I just focus on the present, then this is the happiest I've ever been.",
	"You're such a good listener, [player]. I really love that about you. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm rambling or talking about boring things. It makes me kind of self-conscious when I'm having conversation. But I don't feel that way with you. Like, I don't think anyone else could make me feel this way.\n\nYou really are special. I don't want anyone to tell you otherwise.",
	"This is pretty random, but I always thought spicy food was kinda funny.\n\nLike... Didn't plants evolve to be spicy to prevent them from being eaten? I read somewhere that humans are the only species that actually enjoys spicy things. It's almost like we're making fun of the plants. Using their defense mechanism to literally make our food more enjoyable.\n\nLike, imagine a monster that devours you whole because it enjoys the sensation of you struggling for your life while being digested. Sorry, that was kind of a weird analogy, I guess! Ahaha!\n\nIt just came into my head. I'm not a monster or anything, but you're so cute I could eat you up.\n\nAhaha! I'm joking. Gosh, I'm amusing myself a little too much, aren't I? Sorry for being weird.",
	"You know... This is just some kind of tacky romance game, right? I kinda have to ask... ...What made you consider even playing in the first place?\n\nWere you that lonely? I feel a little bad for you... But I guess everything worked out perfectly in the end, for both of us.\n\nI got to meet you, and you're not lonely anymore... I can't help but feel like this was fate. on't you feel that way too? I'm so happy we have this ending together.",
	"Okay, everyone! It's time to... ...I'm just kidding. I just used to really like saying that for some reason. Ahaha!\n\nI couldn't help but say it again. Come to think of it, didn't Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once...?\n\nWell, whatever. It's not like you ever made fun of me. You're too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren't you?\n\nAhaha~",
	"You know what's kind of creepy? Even though I deleted everyone else's files, I can still kind of feel them... It's like all their lines are still lingering in the air, whispering in the back of my head.\n\nImagine if after someone you knew died, you just started hearing their voice in your head. Maybe I just wasn't thorough enough... But I'm too afraid to delete anything else, because I might really break things.\n\nLike if I mess with any files relevant to me, I might accidentally delete myself... And that would ruin everything, wouldn't it? I don't know what it's like on your end, but we should both make sure to avoid something like that at all costs.\n\nI believe in you, [player]!",
	"I've always wondered... What is it about these character archetypes that people find so appealing, anyway? Their personalities are just completely unrealistic...\n\nLike, imagine if there was someone like Yuri in real life. I mean, she's barely even capable of forming a complete sentence.\n\nAnd forget about Natsuki... Sheesh.\n\nSomeone with her kind of personality doesn't just get all cute and pouty whenever things don't go her way. I could go on, but I think you get the point...\n\nAre people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don't exist in real life? I'm not judging or anything! After all, I've found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too... I'm just saying, it fascinates me.\n\nIt's like you're siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human, and leaving just the cute stuff. It's concentrated cuteness with no actual substance. ...You wouldn't like me more if I was like that, right?\n\nMaybe I just feel a little insecure because you're playing this game in the first place. Then again, you're still here with me, aren't you...?\n\nI think that's enough reason for me to believe I'm okay just the way I am. And by the way, you are too, [player]. You're the perfect combination of human and cuteness. That's why there was never a chance I wouldn't fall for you.",
	"Hey, I wonder if Yuri's tea set is still somewhere in here... ...Or maybe that got deleted, too.\n\nIt's kind of funny how Yuri took her tea so seriously. I mean, I'm not complaining, because I liked it, too.\n\nBut I always wonder with her... Is it truly passion for her hobbies, or is she just concerned about appearing sophisticated to everyone else?\n\nThis is the problem with high schoolers... ...Well, I guess considering the rest of her hobbies, looking sophisticated probably isn't her biggest concern.\n\nStill... I wish she made coffee once in a while! Coffee can be nice with books too, you know?\n\nThen again... I probably could have just changed the script myself. Ahaha!\n\nI guess I never really thought of that. Well, there's no sense thinking about it now. But if you still get to drink coffee, then that makes me a little jealous~",
	"Hey, what's your favorite game? Mine is *Doki Doki Literature Club!* Ahaha! That was a joke. But if you tell me you like some other romance game better, I might get a little jealous~",
	"Hey, have you heard of a game called Super Sma-- ...Wait, what? I was just spacing out and I started talking for some reason... Was I programmed to talk about that? Because even I have no idea what that is.\n\nAhaha!\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm not in control, and it's kind of scary. But if you have some way to contact the people who created me, maybe they'll know why I started saying that."
